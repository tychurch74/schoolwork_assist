# Intermediate Python Lesson Plan

## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Overview
OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to model real-world entities, each object representing a specific instance of a class. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, and objects can interact with each other.

### Example Project
Create a simple bank account management system with classes for Account, Customer, and Bank. Implement methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking balances.

## 2. List Comprehensions

### Overview
List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists using a single line of code. They provide a more readable and efficient way to create new lists by applying an expression to each item in a sequence.

### Example Project
Given a list of words, use a list comprehension to generate a new list containing the length of each word, and another list with words longer than a given length.

## 3. Lambda Functions

### Overview
Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword. They can have multiple arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.

### Example Project
Write a program that takes a list of numbers and sorts them based on a custom sorting rule. Use a lambda function to specify the sorting key (e.g., sort by remainder when divided by a given number).

## 4. Async IO

### Overview
Async IO is a Python library for writing concurrent code using async/await syntax. It allows you to run multiple tasks concurrently without the need for threading or multiprocessing, which simplifies code and improves performance.

### Example Project
Create a simple web scraper that fetches multiple web pages concurrently and extracts information from them (e.g., headlines from news websites).

## 5. Algorithms

### Overview
Algorithms are sets of instructions for performing a specific task or solving a specific problem. Learning common algorithms can improve your problem-solving skills and the efficiency of your code.

### Example Project
Implement a simple search algorithm like binary search, and use it to search for an item in a sorted list.

## 6. Data Structures

### Overview
Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer. They allow you to efficiently perform operations on the data. Some common data structures include lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

### Example Project
Implement a basic stack and queue using Python lists, and use them in a simple use case, like managing print jobs or undo/redo functionality.

## 7. Time Complexity

### Overview
Time complexity is the measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. It's important to understand time complexity to write efficient code and make informed decisions when choosing algorithms.

### Example Project
Write a program that compares the performance of two sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort and quick sort) by measuring their execution time on different input sizes.

# Final Project: Inventory Management System

Create an inventory management system that incorporates all the above concepts:

1. Use OOP to model products, suppliers, and warehouses.
2. Use list comprehensions to filter and transform lists of products.
3. Use lambda functions for custom sorting rules (e.g., sort products by price or quantity).
4. Implement Async IO to handle requests to multiple suppliers' APIs concurrently.
5. Apply algorithms such as search and sorting to manage the inventory.
6. Use appropriate data structures to store and organize data.
7. Analyze the time complexity of various operations in the system.
